# Chat-bot
 I created an intelligent chatbot by combining GPT-2 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextually correct answers.
 Added a customized knowledge retrieval system that utilized TF-IDF, augmented with Hugging Face Transformers, for the purpose of
 generating natural language. Expertise shown in the domain of NLP, pre-trained language models, and retrieval mechanisms in creating
 a scalable and modular chatbot. Technologies applied are Python, Scikit-learn, and Hugging Face.
